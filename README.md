## Web3 Social chat

> Decentralized Twitter

ðŸ›  Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), [Bundlr](https://bundlr.network/), [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/), GraphQL, & [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/)


### How it works

This is a working prototype of a basic web3-native social application. Features include:

- Permanent post storage (Arweave)
- Editable, self-sovereign user profiles (Ceramic [self.id](https://self.id/))
- [GraphQL queries](https://gql-guide.vercel.app/)
- Filtering at protocol level (not on client)
- Fund and check balance of Bundlr with Matic on Polygon
- [Pagination](https://gql-guide.vercel.app/#pagination) can also be implemented fairly easily with a few extra lines of code at protocol level
